# 109550046_ML_Final

## Description

Final project for Introduction to Machine Learning

Train a ML model to predict product failures by Kaggle Tabular Playground Series - Aug 2022

## Requirements

Environment: google colab

```setup
!pip install optuna
```

## Training

To train the model(s) , run 109550046_Final_train.ipynb:

## Evaluation

To evaluate my model run 109550046_Final_inference.ipynb:

It will load the training model from my 109550046_Final_train.ipynb, and produce the results that can submit to Kaggle


## Training Models

You can download training models in github(model) and here:
